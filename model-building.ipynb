    "### Model Building\n",
    "- It is a process to create mathematical model for estimating/predicting the future behaviour   based on the past data.\n",
    "- Example: A retail bank wants to know the default behaviour of its credit card customers. They want to predict the probability of the default for each customer with in next 3 months\n",
    "- Probability of the default will lies between 0 and 1\n",
    "- Assume for the moment that every customer has a 10% of the default rate.\n",
    "So the probability for each customer for next 3 months = 0.1\n",
